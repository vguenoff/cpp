# 02Basic Syntax

## Explicit casting

▪ If you really want to store a bigger type in a smaller type
▪ Explicitly cast the bigger type to the smaller type:
▪ smallType smallVar = (smallType) bigVar;
▪ smallType smallVar = static_cast<smallType> bigVar;
▪ Can lose accuracy if value can't be represented in a smaller type
