# 02Basic Syntax

## Explicit casting

▪ If you really want to store a bigger type in a smaller type
▪ Explicitly cast the bigger type to the smaller type:
▪ smallType smallVar = (smallType) bigVar;
▪ smallType smallVar = static_cast<smallType> bigVar;
▪ Can lose accuracy if value can't be represented in a smaller type

# 03Functions

# 04Arrays as Pointers

▪ Pointer - a variable that holds the address of another
variable in the memory
▪ The address stores its value
▪ Pointers have data type
▪ Arrays can be represented as pointers
▪ The array is a sequence of variables stored in memory
▪ The array name points to the first item
